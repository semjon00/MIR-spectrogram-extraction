Currently, the physics calculation is discrete (on each sample).
This is not good, especially for higher frequences.
This file contains an attempt to solve the continuous physic task
(how to calculate the continuous physics).

Assumptions:
1.  Friction acceleration can be applied at the end of the continum, to both the speed and the position.
    We do not need to account for it in the formulas.
2.  Input acceleration is linear between the start and the end of the continum.

Notes:
k means some coeficient that can be calculated beforehand. So, k does not necessarily equal k.
Integrals everywhere are from 0 to x.

The equations (hopefully correct):
A_i(x) = k * x + k          // Input acceleration
A_p(x) = k * P(x)           // Pull acceleration
V'(x) = A_i(x) + A_p(x)     // Velocity
P'(x) = V(x)                // Position


Partial solution (hopefully correct):
V'(x) = A_i(x) + A_p(x)
V'(x) = k * x + k + k * P(x)
V''(x) = (k * x + k + k * P(x))'
V''(x) = (k * x)' + (k * P(x))'
V''(x) = k + k * P'(x)
V''(x) = k + k * V(x)           [Solve V(x) for x = 1]
