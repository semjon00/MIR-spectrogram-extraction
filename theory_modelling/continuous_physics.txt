Currently, the physics calculation is discrete (on each sample).
This is not good, especially for higher frequences.
This file contains an attempt to solve the continuous physic task
(how to calculate the continuous physics).

Input acceleration will be counted as constant between the start and the end of the continum.

The equations (hopefully correct):
A_i(x) = с_in_0                     // Input acceleration
A_p(x) = с_pl_0 * P(x)              // Pull acceleration
V'(x) = c_nf * (A_i(x) + A_p(x))    // Velocity
P'(x) = V(x)                        // Position

Therefore:
V'(x) = c_nf * (с_in_0 + с_pl_0 * P(x)) = c_in + с_pl * P(x)
P'(x) = V(x)
